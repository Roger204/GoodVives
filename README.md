# GoodVives

I expect the best, aspire for the best, and do my best.
As the sun shines after the night is over, so success appears after problems and failure.
If some people achieve success, it means that others can too, including you.
It does not cost money to think, feel and act positively, and it does not cost money to think, feel and act negatively, so why not choose to think, feel and act positively?
If you want success, you don’t sit down moan and complain. Instead, make plans and carry them out.
If you don’t like the kind of life you are living now, start making changes. You can live a different lifestyle. All you need is ambition, motivation, a good plan and perseverance. 
Every thought, every emotion and every word you express, affects you and the people around you. Therefore, be careful of what you think, feel and say.
I appreciate the goods things in my life and thank the Universe for them.
I can learn new skills and I can improve every area of my life.
I believe in myself and in my ability to find love, progress in my work, and achieve success in everything I do.
I have the motivation and inner strength to invest all the effort needed in following my dreams and goals and making them come true.
I invite happiness, love, peace and satisfaction into my life.
I welcome every day with love and joy.
I am open to new experiences, new possibilities and new opportunities.
